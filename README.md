## ðŸ§ž Deployment <a name="deployment"></a>

### Deployment â€“ Run locally <a name="#deploymentRunLocally"></a>
1. Prerequisite:
   - Make sure [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) are installed on your computer. You can download both at nodejs.org (NPM is included in your Node installation).
   - Please see `.nvmrc` file at the root of `vesta` repo containing the Node version.

It provides a command-line interface where you can install different versions with a single command, set a default, switch between them, etc. Here is [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
